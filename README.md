# NYC_Citibike_Challenge

Background

 There is a bike-sharing program in Des Moines I will be convinceing the investors to pick our program. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

I will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

*Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
*Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
*Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
